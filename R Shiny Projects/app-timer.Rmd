output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(shiny)

# Define UI for displaying current time ----
ui <- fluidPage(

  h2(textOutput("currentTime"))

)

```

```{r}
# Define server logic to show current time, update every second ----
server <- function(input, output, session) {

  output$currentTime <- renderText({
    invalidateLater(1000, session)
    paste("The current time is", Sys.time())
  })

}
```

```{r}
# Create Shiny app ----
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
